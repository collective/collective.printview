====================
A functional doctest
====================

First, we must perform some setup. We use the testbrowser that is shipped
with Five, as this provides proper Zope 2 integration. Most of the 
documentation, though, is in the underlying zope.testbrower package.

    >>> from Products.Five.testbrowser import Browser
    >>> browser = Browser()
    >>> portal_url = self.portal.absolute_url()

Test if our front page has printview view available.

    >>> browser.open(portal_url)
